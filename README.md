# Integration and communication between react components and vanilla JS

# How to run

- install dependencies (yarn or npm install)
- run `yarn watch`
- open index.html in the live preview (browser)

# How it works

To be able to communicate between the code inside 'legado.js' and 'App.tsx' an singleton class was created to to act as a message broker between both codebases.
